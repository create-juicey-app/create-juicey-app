<h2>Hi uhhm</h2>
<h3>Can i ask you a question?</h3>
<h1>How the hell did you find me?</h1>

I may not have a degree in computer science (yet), but I'm already on my way to becoming a professional idiot.
I do NextJS, Lua, and Python.
Im not adult yet so dont recruit me yet lol
I can write code that's just as buggy and confusing.
I love & hate putting comments in my code
