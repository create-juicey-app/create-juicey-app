<h3>Well, uhm im Juicey</h3>


I may not have a degree in computer science (yet), but I'm already on my way to becoming a professional idiot.
I do NextJS, Lua, and Python. ðŸ¥–And im frenchðŸ¥–
Im not adult yet so dont recruit me yet lol
I can write code that's just as buggy and confusing.
I love & hate putting comments in my code
